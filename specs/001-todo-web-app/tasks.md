# Tasks: Todo Web Application with User Authentication

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-todo-web-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, research.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in this feature specification. Test tasks are not included in this task breakdown.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/` for FastAPI application
- **Frontend**: `frontend/` for Next.js application
- **Specs**: `specs/001-todo-web-app/` for design documents

---

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

- [ ] T026c [US1] Ensure DB tables exist for local dev (call init_db on startup in backend/main.py)
- [ ] T026d [US1] Fix bcrypt/passlib compatibility in backend (pin bcrypt<4 so password hashing works)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Users can sign up, log in, and access protected routes.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Add Task (Priority: P2)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Update Task (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable authenticated users to edit their task details to fix mistakes or update information

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Delete Task (Priority: P3)

- [ ] T084 Create demo video (90 seconds) showcasing core features

**Checkpoint**: Documentation complete. Project is ready for handoff.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P2 → P3 → P3 → P2)
- **Integration (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Deployment (Phase 10)**: Depends on Integration completion
- **Documentation (Phase 11)**: Depends on Deployment completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 (need tasks to edit) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US3 (need tasks to delete) but should be independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US2 (need tasks to toggle) but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Backend models and endpoints before frontend components
- API client methods before component integration
- Core implementation before styling and refinement
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] in Phase 1 can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] in Phase 2 can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, multiple user stories can be worked on in parallel
- Backend and frontend tasks within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Deployment tasks marked [P] in Phase 10 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Add Task)

```bash
# Launch backend and frontend validation models in parallel:
Task: "Create Pydantic validation model for task creation in backend/models.py"
Task: "Create API client method for creating tasks in frontend/lib/api.ts"

# After backend endpoint is created, frontend components can be built in parallel:
Task: "Create TaskForm component in frontend/components/TaskForm.tsx"
Task: "Add form validation on frontend in frontend/components/TaskForm.tsx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T017) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018-T026)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo authentication flow if ready

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Authentication) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Add Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (View Tasks) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 6 (Mark Complete) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 4 (Update Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 5 (Delete Task) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
8. Integration testing → Production deployment → Documentation

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T017)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Add Task) + User Story 3 (View Tasks)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Mark Complete) + User Story 4 (Update Task)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Joint integration testing (Phase 9)
5. Deployment and documentation (Phases 10-11)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All backend tasks include user_id verification for security
- All frontend tasks include loading states and error handling
- JWT tokens extracted from httpOnly cookies for protected routes
- All task operations (create, read, update, delete, toggle) verify user ownership

---

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 84
- **Setup Phase**: 5 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 12 tasks
- **User Story 1 (Authentication)**: 9 tasks
- **User Story 2 (Add Task)**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 3 (View Tasks)**: 11 tasks

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1) = 26 tasks

**Format Validation**: ✅ ALL tasks follow the required checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
