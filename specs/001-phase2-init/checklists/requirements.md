# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase II Initialization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-06
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) *Note: Tech stack included as explicit constraints per project mandate*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) *Note: SC-004 verifies the stack mandate, which is an explicit success condition for this phase*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (Negative tests in User Stories)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification includes explicit Technical Constraints section as this is a "Phase II Initialization" feature where the tech stack is a primary requirement.
